# clusterExplainR 

This R package provides the implementation of the clusterExplainR. The explainer allows the creation of post-hoc model-agnostic global and local explanations for mixed data clustering.

## Usage 

Simply install the R package with its dependencies and feel free to explain your clusters. Be aware, that the current implementation cannot deal with missing values, therefore please ensure that you do an appropriate preprocessing.

A usage example is provided in the [clusterExplain-R example vignette](/vignettes/clusterExplainR-example.Rmd)
